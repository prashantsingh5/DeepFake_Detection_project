## Project Overview

Deepfake technology poses significant risks in various domains, including medical imaging. This project focuses on identifying whether knee osteoarthritis scans are authentic or generated by deepfake techniques.

The system includes:
- A robust classifier based on **EfficientNet-B3**.
- Evaluation tools to measure model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.
- A drag-and-drop **Gradio interface** for real-time image classification.

## Features
- **Training Pipeline**: Includes data loading, augmentation, and model training scripts.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Outputs classification accuracy, confusion matrix, and detailed classification reports.
- **Gradio Interface**: User-friendly interface for real-time predictions with drag-and-drop support.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Generates a confusion matrix and visualizes evaluation metrics.

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model

Run the following script to train the model:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

- Input: Dataset organized into real_images and fake_images.
- Output: The trained model saved as models/final_model.pth.

### 2. Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model on the validation set:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

**Output:**
- Confusion matrix saved as results/evaluation/confusion_matrix.png.
- Detailed classification report printed to the console.

  
### 3. Using the Gradio Interface

Launch the Gradio app for real-time predictions:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open the app in your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:7860. Drag and drop an image or upload it to classify it as Real or Fake.

## Results

- **Confusion Matrix:** Saved in results/evaluation/confusion_matrix.png.
- **Classification Report:** Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics for the validation set.
